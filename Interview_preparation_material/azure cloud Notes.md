------------------------------
1.Introduce yourself??
answer:- "Hello, my name is Jay Prakash. I bring over 5.8 years of IT experience, with more than 4.5 years of dedicated expertise in Azure Cloud Administration at L2 and L3 levels. Currently, I’m associated with Kale Logistics, where I’ve been instrumental in architecting, deploying, and managing comprehensive Azure infrastructure solutions that drive performance, security, and cost efficiency.

One of my most significant projects was for a U.S.-based logistics company, where we developed a real-time fleet tracking system leveraging Azure cloud services. The client had IoT sensors integrated into their vehicles, continuously collecting data such as GPS coordinates, fuel levels, temperature, and system diagnostics. This data was transmitted to Azure for real-time processing and actionable insights.

In my role as an Azure Administrator, I led the design and implementation of a secure, scalable cloud environment. I provisioned and optimized virtual machines (Windows/Linux), configured NSGs, deployed load balancers, implemented Availability Sets and Zones, and set up robust storage solutions including Blob and File Shares.

I was also responsible for setting up Azure Backup and Disaster Recovery strategies, ensuring business continuity and data protection. Monitoring was a key focus area—I configured Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights to maintain infrastructure health and generate proactive alerts.

2.	Why you want to quit your present job?
answer:-Our current project has been successfully delivered to another client organization and is now in the winding-down phase. This transition process may take around 7–8 months, and as of now, there is no confirmed information about future project allocations within the company. Due to this uncertainty and for the sake of job security, I am actively seeking new opportunities.

Additionally, as a married individual with growing responsibilities, stability and career continuity are very important to me. I am looking for a role where I can contribute effectively while also ensuring long-term growth and professional security.

3.	How many team members in your process?
answer:-How many team members in your process?"Our team consists of 8 members, comprising a balanced mix of L2 and L3 support engineers. We work collaboratively to manage and optimize Azure infrastructure, with each member specializing in areas such as Virtual Machines, networking, storage, security, backups, and monitoring. At the L2 level, we handle in-depth troubleshooting, performance tuning, and incident resolution, while L3 focuses on complex issue analysis, root cause identification, and implementing long-term solutions.

We follow a structured escalation matrix to ensure SLA adherence and minimal downtime. Our team also collaborates closely with DevOps, application support, and architecture teams to streamline deployments, automate tasks, and drive operational excellence across the Azure environment."

4.	Who is your project customer?
answer:-Currently, I am working with Kale Logistics Solutions, a leading USA-based company that specializes in providing innovative software solutions for the logistics and supply chain industry. Their flagship product, Kale Logistics' Freight Management System, is a comprehensive platform that streamlines end-to-end logistics operations, enhancing efficiency and optimizing supply chain management. Our team supports the Azure-based infrastructure behind their solutions, ensuring high availability, scalability, and security for their global clientele."

5.	What is your daily job routine?
answer:- *"My daily job routine begins with accessing the company Azure portal, where I systematically monitor all customer tenants to ensure smooth operations across their cloud environments. I start by checking the status of all Azure Automation Runbooks to confirm that scheduled tasks and scripts are running successfully.

I then review the Azure Backup status for each customer—verifying the most recent backup, checking recovery point availability, and ensuring all associated backup servers are running properly. In case of any backup failure, I investigate the root cause and take necessary troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue promptly.

Next, I perform patch management activities. I check the status of Windows and server patches, and if any updates are pending, I refer to the official Windows Patch Catalog for detailed KB information. Once reviewed, I coordinate with the customer for downtime approvals and proceed with safe patch implementation.

I also monitor Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN tunnels to ensure they are connected and stable. If any tunnels appear to be disconnected or down, I immediately notify the customer and assist in troubleshooting on their side.

Another key task is performance monitoring. I review CPU utilization on customer servers—if any server exceeds 90% usage, I investigate the underlying processes or services consuming high resources and take corrective action.

Additionally, I check the Resource Health of all Azure resources, ensuring no components are in a degraded or failed state.

On a monthly basis, I perform a detailed audit of NSG (Network Security Group) rules to verify they are aligned with security best practices. For any public IPs allowed in NSG rules, I coordinate with customers to verify usage. If any unused IPs are identified, I proceed with their removal after obtaining proper customer approval.

This proactive approach helps maintain optimal performance, security, and compliance across all supported Azure environments."**

6.	What do you implement in Cloud?
answer:-In my current role, I am actively involved in deploying and managing a wide range of Azure cloud services to support customer infrastructure needs. My cloud implementation responsibilities include:

Virtual Machine Management: Deploy and configure Windows and Linux VMs, set up Availability Sets, resize data disks, redeploy faulty VMs, and install antimalware for endpoint protection.

Storage Solutions: Create and manage Blob Storage, File Shares, and assist clients in accessing cloud storage using Azure Storage Explorer on their local systems.

Networking and Traffic Management: Deploy and configure Azure Traffic Manager, Load Balancers, and ensure high availability and traffic distribution.

Backup and Disaster Recovery: Set up Azure Backup Server, MARS agent-based backups, and configure backup schedules for both short-term and long-term retention. Perform backup restoration and participate in quarterly backup restore drills validated by the application team.

Azure Active Directory: Manage user identities and access in Azure AD, including user creation, password resets, account disablement, and domain controller deployment on Azure. Handle AAD migrations, enforce MFA, and manage policies through Identity and Access Management (IAM).

SQL Services: Create SQL backups as per client requirements including point-in-time and long-term retention backups. Manage SQL firewall rules to allow/deny access based on IP.

Automation: Create and maintain automation runbooks aligned with client business hours and maintenance windows to optimize resource usage and reduce manual effort.

Monitoring & Reporting: Monitor CPU, memory, and network utilization using metrics and activity logs. Generate and send detailed monthly reports to clients covering resource usage, backup summaries, and recovery point status to ensure transparency and accountability."

7.	Which ticketing tool working in your organization?
answer:-"In my current organization, we use ServiceNow and Jira as our primary ticketing and task management tools. ServiceNow is used extensively for managing incident tickets, service requests, and change management processes. Jira, on the other hand, is primarily used for project-related tasks, tracking progress, and managing sprint-based activities.

We receive user requests and incidents through the Service Desk team, which assigns tasks to L1 and L2 engineers based on priority and complexity. As part of the L2 support team, I handle escalated issues, perform in-depth troubleshooting, and ensure timely resolution within defined SLAs. The ticketing system helps us maintain accountability, track issue history, and streamline communication with stakeholders and end-users."

8.	Work on Pricing Calculator?
answer:- "I actively work with the Azure Pricing Calculator to create accurate cost estimates based on customer requirements. After gathering infrastructure needs from the client—such as compute, storage, networking, and backup—I prepare detailed pricing estimates that align with their business and technical goals.

These estimates are used to create formal proposals, which are then shared with the customer for review and approval. Once approved, I proceed to design and deploy the infrastructure as per the proposal, ensuring all configurations are optimized for cost, performance, and scalability. I also provide solution walkthroughs and live demos to help clients understand their environment and how it meets their requirements."

- `git pull`: Download updates  
- `git status`: Check status  
- `git log`: View commit history

**4. How do you connect Git with Azure Repos?**  
You can connect using:  
- HTTPS with credentials or PAT (Personal Access Token)  
- SSH authentication (recommended for automation)

---

**5. What is a Git branch?**  
A branch is an **independent line of development**. Developers create branches to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

---

### ✅ **L3-Level Git Interview Questions**

---

**6. How does Git handle merge conflicts?**  
When two branches modify the same part of a file, Git throws a **merge conflict**. You must manually resolve it using editors like VS Code or via command line and then commit the resolved file.

---

**7. What’s the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?**  
- `git merge` combines changes and creates a **merge commit**  
- `git rebase` applies changes **linearly** without extra commits, making history cleaner

---

**8. What is a detached HEAD in Git?**  
It means you're not on a branch but on a **specific commit**. You can explore commits but should not make permanent changes in detached mode.

---

**9. What is `.gitignore` file?**  
It tells Git which files or folders to **ignore during commits**, such as log files, IDE settings, or sensitive credentials.

---

**10. How do you undo a Git commit?**  
- `git reset --soft HEAD~1`: Keep changes staged  
- `git reset --mixed HEAD~1`: Keep changes unstaged  
- `git reset --hard HEAD~1`: Discard changes completely

---

### ✅ **Architect-Level Git Interview Questions**

---

**11. How do you implement Git branching strategy in a DevOps pipeline?**  
- Use **GitFlow** or **Trunk-based development**  
- Enforce **pull request** policies  
- Use **feature branches**, **develop branch**, and **release branch**  
- Apply **CI/CD integration** with Azure Pipelines for each branch

---

**12. How do you ensure Git repository security in an enterprise?**  
- Use **Azure DevOps permissions**  
- Enable **branch protection rules**  
- Use **Personal Access Tokens** instead of passwords  
- Restrict **force pushes** and direct commits to main

---

**13. How do you manage large repositories efficiently?**  
- Use **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**  
- Split into **submodules or monorepos**  
- Archive old branches  
- Optimize using `git gc` and `git prune`

---

**14. What is Git submodule and when to use it?**  
A Git submodule is a repo inside another repo. It's used to include **external projects** (like libraries) without copying code manually.

### ✅ **Git Troubleshooting Scenarios**

---

### 🛠️ **Problem: Git push fails with "Authentication failed"**  
**Solution:**  
- If using HTTPS: Update **Personal Access Token (PAT)**  
- Use SSH keys and configure with Azure DevOps  
- Re-authenticate using:  
  ```bash  
  git credential-manager-core erase  
  ```

---

### 🛠️ **Problem: Merge conflict during `git pull`**  
**Solution:**  
- Use `git status` to see conflict files  
- Open files and resolve manually  
- After resolving:  
  ```bash  
  git add <file>  
  git commit  
  ```

---

### 🛠️ **Problem: Accidentally committed sensitive data (like secrets)**  
**Solution:**  
- Remove from history using:  
  ```bash  
  git filter-branch --force --index-filter  
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch <file>" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
  ```  
- Push with force: `git push --force`  
- Rotate secrets immediately

---

### 🛠️ **Problem: Git pull overwrites local changes**  
**Solution:**  
- Use `git stash` before pull to save changes  
  ```bash  
  git stash  
  git pull  
  git stash pop  
  ```

---

### 🛠️ **Problem: Git shows "You have diverged" error**  
**Solution:**  
- Your local and remote branches have different commits  
- Use `git pull --rebase` or `git push --force` carefully  
- Always check with `git log --oneline --graph`

---

### 🛠️ **Problem: Git history is cluttered with unnecessary commits**  
**Solution:**  
- Use interactive rebase:  
  ```bash  
  git rebase -i HEAD~5  
  ```  
- Squash commits  
- Force push if on personal or feature branch
