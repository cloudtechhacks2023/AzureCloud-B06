### üõ†Ô∏è **Remediation Tasks**

**Purpose**: Automatically correct non-compliant resources to bring them into compliance with policies.

**Key Concepts**:

- **DeployIfNotExists**: Deploys a resource if it doesn't exist.
- **Modify**: Alters existing resources to comply with policy.
- **Remediation Task**: An operation that applies the necessary changes to non-compliant resources.

**Process**:

1. **Assign Policy**: Assign a policy or initiative to a scope (e.g., subscription, resource group).
2. **Identify Non-Compliant Resources**: Azure evaluates resources against the policy.
3. **Create Remediation Task**: Initiate a task to correct non-compliant resources.
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track the remediation task's status and ensure compliance is achieved. ([List of built-in policy initiatives - Azure Policy | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-initiatives?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
