### **Azure Bastion: Secure RDP/SSH Access Without Public IPs**  

#### **Overview:**  
Azure Bastion is a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that provides secure and seamless Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH) access to Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) without exposing them to public IP addresses.  

#### **Key Features:**  
- **Secure Access:** Eliminates the need for public IPs, reducing the attack surface.  
- **Browser-Based Connectivity:** Provides RDP and SSH access directly through the Azure Portal using HTML5.  
- **Integrated Azure AD Authentication (Preview):** Supports Azure Active Directory-based authentication for additional security.  
- **No Agent Required:** Works without installing any agents on VMs.  
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Ensures a secure connection with SSL/TLS encryption.  
- **Private Connectivity:** Supports Virtual Network Peering, allowing access to VMs across peered VNETs.  
- **Scalable Architecture:** Can handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently.  

#### **Deployment Methods:**  
1. **Basic SKU:** Provides RDP/SSH access within a single virtual network.  
2. **Standard SKU:** Supports connectivity to VMs across peered virtual networks and advanced security features.  

#### **How Azure Bastion Works:**  
1. A Bastion host is deployed inside a Virtual Network (VNet).  
2. Users initiate RDP/SSH sessions through the Azure Portal.  
3. Azure Bastion securely tunnels the connection to the target VM using an internal private IP.  
4. The session is fully encrypted and does not expose the VMâ€™s public IP.  

#### **Benefits of Azure Bastion:**  
- **Enhanced Security:** Eliminates the need for public IPs, reducing potential attack vectors.  
- **Simplified Management:** No need for VPNs, Jump Servers, or third-party tools.  
- **Seamless Integration:** Works natively with Azure Virtual Networks.  
- **Compliance Ready:** Helps meet enterprise security and compliance requirements.  

#### **Use Cases:**  
- **Secure Remote Administration:** Access VMs in production environments without public exposure.  
- **Hybrid Cloud Management:** Manage Azure-based workloads securely from on-premises environments.  
- **Zero-Trust Security Model:** Ensures least privilege access and minimizes attack surfaces.  

#### **Limitations & Considerations:**  
- **No File Transfer Support:** As of now, Azure Bastion does not support direct file transfer.  
- **Limited Protocol Support:** Only RDP and SSH are supported; no support for other protocols.  
- **Cost Consideration:** Pricing is based on the number of connected hours and outbound data transfer.  

#### **Alternatives to Azure Bastion:**  
- **VPN Gateway:** Secure remote access via Point-to-Site (P2S) or Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN.  
- **Azure Jump Box (Jump Server):** A manually configured VM for remote access.  
- **Azure Private Link & PaaS Services:** Secure connectivity to Azure resources without public exposure.
