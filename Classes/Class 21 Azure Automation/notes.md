# **Azure Infrastructure Management Methods**  

Managing infrastructure in **Microsoft Azure** can be done through different approaches:  

### **1. Azure Portal (GUI-Based Management)**  
Azure Portal is a **web-based** interface that allows users to visually create, configure, and manage Azure resources.  

#### **Key Features:**  
- Provides a **user-friendly interface** for managing resources.  
- Allows **real-time monitoring** of Azure services.  
- Supports **role-based access control (RBAC)** for security.  
- Includes **Cloud Shell** for executing CLI and PowerShell commands.  
- Provides **cost management and billing** insights.  

#### **Use Cases:**  
- Best for **small-scale deployments** and one-time configurations.  
- Useful for **troubleshooting and monitoring resources**.  
- Suitable for **managing permissions and security settings**.  

#### **Limitations:**  
- **Manual and time-consuming** for repetitive tasks.  
- **Not scalable** for large infrastructure management.  
- **Prone to human errors** due to manual configurations.

### **2. Azure Automation (Reducing Manual Efforts)**  
Azure Automation helps in automating infrastructure management, reducing manual intervention, and improving efficiency.  

#### **Key Azure Automation Tools:**  
- **Azure Automation Account**: Automates workflows using **Runbooks**.  
- **Azure Logic Apps**: Creates workflows integrating Azure services and external applications.  
- **Azure Functions**: Enables serverless automation for event-driven tasks.  
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines**: Automates CI/CD pipelines for software deployment.  
- **Update Management**: Ensures automatic patching and updates for VMs.  

#### **Advantages:**  
- Reduces **manual effort** and **human errors**.  
- Ensures **consistency** in infrastructure management.  
- Supports **hybrid cloud automation** (on-premises + Azure).  

---

### **3. Imperative Method (Step-by-Step Execution Approach)**  
The **imperative approach** focuses on executing step-by-step commands to configure and manage Azure resources.  

#### **3.1 Azure CLI (Command-Line Interface)**  
- Cross-platform command-line tool for managing Azure resources.  
- Supports scripting for **automation** and **infrastructure management**.  
- Works across **Windows, macOS, Linux, and Cloud Shell**.  

#### **3.2 Azure PowerShell**  
- Uses cmdlets for managing Azure services.  
- Best suited for **Windows administrators** and **Azure Automation**.  
- Supports advanced **scripting and automation workflows**.  

#### **3.3 Azure REST API**  
- Provides direct interaction with Azure services over **HTTP/HTTPS**.  
- Suitable for **custom integrations** and **third-party applications**.  
- Enables **automated deployments and monitoring** via API calls.  

#### **3.4 Azure Python SDK**  
- Allows programmatic management of Azure resources using Python.  
- Useful for **AI, ML, and automation workflows**.  
- Integrates well with **Azure Functions and Serverless Computing**.  

---

### **4. Declarative Method (Infrastructure as Code - IaC)**  
The **declarative approach** defines the desired state of the infrastructure, and Azure ensures it matches the defined configuration.  

#### **4.1 Terraform (HashiCorp Terraform - Open-Source IaC Tool)**  
- Cloud-agnostic Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.  
- Supports **multi-cloud deployments** (Azure, AWS, GCP).  
- Uses **state management** for tracking infrastructure changes.  

#### **4.2 ARM Templates (Azure Resource Manager Templates - JSON-Based IaC)**  
- Defines Azure infrastructure using JSON-based templates.  
- Supports **automated deployments** and **version control**.  
- Ensures consistency in **resource provisioning**.  

#### **4.3 Bicep (Simplified ARM Template Alternative)**  
- A **lightweight** and **easier-to-read** alternative to ARM templates.  
- Improves **developer experience** with a modular approach.  
- Reduces **complexity** in writing deployment configurations.

# **Azure CLI Notes**  

## **What is Azure CLI?**  
Azure Command-Line Interface (**Azure CLI**) is a **cross-platform command-line tool** used to manage and automate Azure resources. It provides a **flexible and scriptable** way to interact with Azure services.  

## **Features of Azure CLI**  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.  
- **Cloud Shell Support**: Can be used directly in the **Azure Portal Cloud Shell**.  
- **Interactive Mode**: Provides real-time command suggestions and execution feedback.  
- **Automation Friendly**: Supports scripting with **Bash, PowerShell, and Python**.  
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses **Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication** for access control.  
- **REST API Integration**: Can interact with Azure services using **Azure REST APIs**.  

## **Installation Methods**  
- **Windows**: Install via **MSI, PowerShell, or Windows Package Manager (winget)**.  
- **Linux**: Available via package managers like **apt (Ubuntu), yum (RHEL), dnf (Fedora), and zypper (SUSE)**.  
- **macOS**: Install using **Homebrew**.  

## **Authentication in Azure CLI**  
- **Azure Login**: Uses `az login` for interactive authentication.  
- **Service Principal Authentication**: Supports authentication via **client ID and secret** for automation.  
- **Managed Identity**: Allows authentication without credentials in Azure services.  

## **Resource Management with Azure CLI**  
- **Subscription Management**: List, switch, and configure Azure subscriptions.  
- **Resource Groups**: Create, update, and delete Azure resource groups.  
- **Virtual Machines**: Manage VM provisioning, start/stop operations, and monitoring.  
- **Networking**: Configure **VNet, Subnets, NSGs, and Load Balancers**.  
- **Storage**: Manage **Blob storage, file shares, and disks**.  
- **Database Services**: Handle **SQL, CosmosDB, and MySQL** services.  

## **Automation and Scripting with Azure CLI**  
- Supports **Bash, PowerShell, and Python scripting** for automation.
