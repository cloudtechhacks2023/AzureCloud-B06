## **Azure Firewall**  
Azure Firewall is a cloud-native and intelligent network security service that protects Azure resources by enforcing policies for inbound and outbound traffic.  

### **Key Features:**  
- **Stateful Inspection**: Monitors and controls traffic flows based on security rules.  
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrates with Microsoft Threat Intelligence to block malicious IPs and domains.  
- **FQDN Filtering**: Controls outbound access by filtering based on Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs).  
- **Network and Application Rules**: Supports rules for both network-level and application-level filtering.  
- **IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System)**: Detects and blocks network threats in real-time.  
- **SNAT and DNAT Support**: Uses Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for outbound connections and Destination NAT (DNAT) for inbound connections.  
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrates with Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Microsoft Sentinel.  
- **Forced Tunneling**: Routes internet-bound traffic through on-premises or third-party security solutions.  
- **Availability Zones**: Provides high availability across multiple zones to ensure resilience.  
- **TLS Inspection**: Enables deep packet inspection for encrypted traffic (HTTPS).  
- **Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Support**: Works with Azure Virtual WAN and integrates with on-premises networks.  

### **Deployment Models:**  
1. **Azure Firewall Standard** â€“ Suitable for general security needs, offering basic filtering and threat intelligence.  
2. **Azure Firewall Premium** â€“ Provides advanced security with TLS inspection, IDPS, and enhanced threat protection.  

### **Common Use Cases:**  
- Protecting Azure Virtual Networks from unauthorized access.  
- Enforcing security policies for internet-bound and inter-VNet traffic.  
- Securing hybrid cloud connectivity with VPN and ExpressRoute.  
- Centralized traffic control in a hub-and-spoke architecture.

## **Azure Key Vault**  
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that securely manages cryptographic keys, secrets, and certificates used in applications and cloud services.  

### **Key Features:**  
- **Secret Management**: Stores sensitive data like passwords, API keys, and connection strings.  
- **Key Management**: Manages encryption keys used for data protection and digital signing.  
- **Certificate Management**: Automates the deployment and renewal of SSL/TLS certificates.  
- **Access Control with RBAC**: Restricts access using Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Azure AD authentication.  
- **HSM (Hardware Security Module) Support**: Ensures FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or Level 3 compliance for cryptographic operations.  
- **Managed Identity Integration**: Allows Azure services to access Key Vault securely without storing credentials.  
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrates with Azure Monitor and Microsoft Defender for threat detection.  
- **Soft Delete & Purge Protection**: Prevents accidental deletion and secures critical secrets from unauthorized removal.  

### **Deployment Models:**  
1. **Standard Key Vault** â€“ Suitable for basic secret and key management needs.  
2. **Premium Key Vault** â€“ Supports HSM-backed keys and enhanced security for enterprise-grade applications.  

### **Common Use Cases:**  
- Storing and managing database connection strings securely.  
- Encrypting storage account data using customer-managed keys.  
- Managing TLS/SSL certificates for web applications.  
- Enabling secure authentication for applications without exposing secrets in code.
