Here are the notes for **Azure Traffic Manager**:  

### **Azure Traffic Manager**  

#### **Introduction**  
- Azure Traffic Manager is a **DNS-based traffic load balancer** that distributes traffic across different regions based on routing methods.  
- It helps in **enhancing availability, performance, and resiliency** of applications by directing user requests efficiently.  
- Works at the **DNS level** and does not perform actual data transfer, only resolves to the best endpoint.  

#### **Key Features**  
- **Global Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple Azure regions.  
- **Multiple Routing Methods**: Supports different traffic routing policies.  
- **Automatic Failover**: Redirects traffic to healthy endpoints if one fails.  
- **Multi-Region Deployment Support**: Ensures redundancy and high availability.  
- **Custom Probes**: Monitors endpoint health using HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP.  
- **Integration with Azure Services**: Works with App Services, VMs, and Cloud Services.  

#### **Traffic Routing Methods**  
1. **Priority (Failover)**  
   - Routes traffic to a primary endpoint.  
   - If the primary fails, traffic is redirected to the next available endpoint.  
   - Suitable for **disaster recovery** scenarios.  

2. **Weighted**  
   - Distributes traffic based on **assigned weights** to endpoints.  
   - Useful for **gradual migration** or **A/B testing**.  

3. **Performance**  
   - Routes users to the **closest (lowest latency) endpoint**.  
   - Helps improve response time for users across different geographical locations.  

4. **Geographic**  
   - Routes traffic based on **user's geographic location**.  
   - Useful for **compliance, localization, or content distribution**.  

5. **Multivalue**  
   - Returns multiple healthy endpoints in response to DNS queries.  
   - Useful for **redundancy and high availability**.  

6. **Subnet**  
   - Routes traffic based on the **source IP address range**.  
   - Useful for **custom routing policies and compliance needs**.  

#### **Working of Azure Traffic Manager**  
1. **User Request**: A user requests an application URL (e.g., `app.example.com`).  
2. **DNS Query**: The request is sent to Azure Traffic Manager via **DNS resolution**.  
3. **Traffic Routing**: Traffic Manager selects the best endpoint based on the configured **routing method**.  
4. **Endpoint Response**: The client gets the IP of the chosen endpoint and directly connects to it.  

#### **Use Cases**  
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Distributes traffic across multiple Azure regions for high availability.  
- **Disaster Recovery**: Routes traffic to secondary regions during outages.  
- **Hybrid Cloud Solutions**: Balances traffic between Azure and on-premises environments.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensures users connect to the nearest available endpoint.  
- **Compliance & Localization**: Serves traffic based on geographic regulations.  

#### **Limitations**  
- Works **only at the DNS level**, so it does not handle actual traffic flow.  
- DNS caching can cause **delayed failover** in some cases.  
- Does not support **real-time traffic routing** like Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway.  

#### **Pricing**  
- Charged based on the **number of DNS queries** and **monitored endpoints**.  
- Free tier is not available, but costs are minimal for most use cases.
