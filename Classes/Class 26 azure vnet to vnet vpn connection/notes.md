# **Azure VNet-to-VNet VPN Connection Notes**

## **Introduction**
- Azure **VNet-to-VNet (VNet VPN Peering)** allows secure communication between two virtual networks over the **Azure VPN Gateway**.
- Useful when **two VNets are in different regions, subscriptions, or tenants**.
- It is a **site-to-site (S2S) VPN connection** between two Azure Virtual Networks using **IPsec/IKE encryption**.

---

## **Key Components**
1. **Virtual Network (VNet)**  
   - A logical isolation of Azure cloud resources.
   - Each VNet must have a unique **address space** (CIDR range).
  
2. **Subnets**  
   - Each VNet contains at least one **subnet**.
   - The **GatewaySubnet** is required to deploy the VPN gateway.

3. **VPN Gateway**  
   - A **virtual network gateway** used for routing encrypted traffic.
   - Must be deployed in the **GatewaySubnet**.
   - Two types:
     - **Route-based (IKEv2, supports dynamic routing)**
     - **Policy-based (IKEv1, supports static routing)**

4. **Public IP Address**  
   - Required for each VPN Gateway.
   - Must be **Static and Standard SKU**.

5. **Connection (IPsec/IKE Tunnel)**  
   - A **secure tunnel** between two Azure VNets.

## **Step-by-Step Configuration**

### **Step 1: Create Two VNets**
- Go to **Azure Portal** â†’ **Virtual Networks** â†’ **Create VNet**.
- Create **two VNets** in different regions or same region.
- Example:
  - **VNet1 (10.0.0.0/16) â€“ East US**
  - **VNet2 (10.1.0.0/16) â€“ West US**

### **Step 2: Create Gateway Subnet in Each VNet**
- Inside each VNet, create a **GatewaySubnet** (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24 for VNet1, 10.1.1.0/24 for VNet2).
- The **GatewaySubnet** should not overlap with other subnets.

### **Step 3: Deploy VPN Gateway in Each VNet**
- Go to **Azure Portal** â†’ **Create VPN Gateway**.
- Select the **VNet** and attach it to the **GatewaySubnet**.
- Choose:
  - **SKU**: VpnGw1 (or higher)
  - **VPN Type**: Route-based
  - **Public IP**: Create a new static IP
- Deploy VPN Gateway for both **VNet1** and **VNet2**.

### **Step 4: Configure VNet-to-VNet Connection**
- Once both **VPN Gateways** are created:
  - Go to **VNet1 VPN Gateway** â†’ **Connections** â†’ **Add**
  - Select **Connection Type: VNet-to-VNet**.
  - Choose **VNet2â€™s VPN Gateway**.
  - Set **Pre-Shared Key (PSK)** (Same key must be used on both sides).

### **Step 5: Verify Connection**
- Go to **Azure Portal** â†’ **VPN Gateway** â†’ **Connections**.
- The status should change from **"Connecting" to "Connected"**.

## **Benefits of VNet-to-VNet VPN**
- **Secure Communication** using **IPsec/IKE encryption**.
- **Global Connectivity**: Connect VNets across different **regions and subscriptions**.
- **Cost-Effective**: No need for an **ExpressRoute**.
- **Multi-Site Connectivity**: A VNet can connect to multiple VNets.

---

## **Troubleshooting**
1. **Connection stuck in "Connecting" state**
   - Check if **Pre-Shared Key (PSK)** is the same on both sides.
   - Ensure **VPN Gateway SKU** is compatible.
   - Verify **address spaces do not overlap**.

2. **Packets not flowing between VNets**
   - Check **Network Security Group (NSG)** rules.
   - Ensure **route propagation** is enabled.

3. **High Latency or Packet Loss**
   - Use **Azure Network Watcher** â†’ **Connection Monitor**.
   - Upgrade VPN Gateway to a higher SKU.

## **Alternative: VNet Peering vs. VNet-to-VNet VPN**
| Feature | VNet Peering | VNet-to-VNet VPN |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Latency** | Low (Fast) | Higher (Depends on VPN gateway) |
| **Encryption** | No (Uses Azure backbone) | Yes (IPsec/IKE) |
| **Cross-Region** | Yes | Yes |
| **Use Case** | Same-region VNets | Different-region VNets, Hybrid |

---

## **Conclusion**
- **VNet-to-VNet VPN** is a **secure and scalable solution** for connecting VNets across regions.
- **Best choice when encryption is needed** or when **VNets belong to different tenants**.
- For **better performance**, consider **Azure VNet Peering** when encryption is not required.
